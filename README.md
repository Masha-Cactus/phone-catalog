In this app, you can browse products by categories and query parameters, add them to your favorites or to the cart.

You can find demo of this projectÂ [HERE](https://Masha-Cactus.github.io/phone-catalog)

The project was implemented using the following technologies and features:
* React for creating interactive interfaces
* TypeScript for better code understanding and easier work with it
* SCSS for style
* React Router DOM for page navigation
* Redux Toolkit for state management
* Redux Persist to persist state after a reboot
* Debounced search to optimize search requests
* API methods that simulate downloading data from the server
* Libraries Swiper for sliders and Leaflet for an interactive map.


The design according to which this App is developed can be viewed at [THIS LINK](https://www.figma.com/file/uEetgWenSRxk9jgiym6Yzp/Phone-catalog-redesign?node-id=1%3A2)

Additionally to the design, I have also implemented:
* Responsive design for various screen resolutions
* Pages for Contacts, Rights, and Returns & Refunds.
* A modal window that appears when a product is saved to the cart or favorites.
